                            <p>So you've decided to learn Python. Maybe you've already taken a look at the
<a class="reference external" href="http://python.org/">Python site</a>. But where to begin? Are there good books
for learning? Programming exercises? What are essential tools one <em>must</em> know
about? I've gotten these questions from several interested friends and
colleagues. Each time, I tried to reply with a helpful mail. At some point I
realized that a nice write-up as blog post would serve just as well and allow
other people to benefit, too.</p>
<p>So, I'd like to help you getting started with Python quickly. But let's be
clear: This post is meant for people who have some experience with
programming and want to get pointers for learning Python. If you are new
to programming, be warned! In that case, this might confuse more than it helps.
That being said, let's go.</p>
<div class="section" id="which-python-version">
<h2>Which Python Version?</h2>
<p>Perhaps you've noticed already: There are two slightly incompatible Python
versions out there:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>2.7</strong>: The 2.x line has been in active use for years. There are tons
of open source libraries and you can do anything short of flying (wait,
you actually <a class="reference external" href="http://xkcd.com/353/">can</a>).</li>
<li><strong>3.2</strong>: This is the new branch, where all future development will take
place. It's still Python goodness all the way down. As a bonus, it improves
a few things and removes some old warts. Unfortunately, that makes it
backwards-incompatible with 2.7. So, <a class="reference external" href="http://python3wos.appspot.com/">not all of those libraries</a> for 2.7 work with 3.2 yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which one to start with, then? Go with Python 2.7, if:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>you want to use certain libraries <em>right now</em> and they don't work under
3.x yet.</li>
<li>you don't know which libraries you need, but it might be lots of different
ones.</li>
<li>you want to work with a web framework. The two largest frameworks
(<a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://pylonsproject.org/">Pyramid/Pylons</a>) don't operate under 3.x
as of now.</li>
</ul>
<p>Go with Python 3.2, if:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>you want to use the language for <em>one</em> specific task and the library you
need is already ported to Python 3.</li>
<li>you just want to learn the language itself and there's no immediate
requirement for 3rd party libraries.</li>
</ul>
<p>When in doubt, pick whichever one - it won't be difficult to switch later.
Already got Python on your system, but don't know which one? Just start
<tt class="docutils literal">python</tt> on the command-line and check the version number it says.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="where-s-the-documentation">
<h2>Where's the documentation?</h2>
<p>If you're like me, you want to know about the official docs, because... well,
because they're <em>official</em> and probably most up-to-date. A first look at the
<a class="reference external" href="http://python.org/doc/">documentation</a> might be overwhelming (&quot;Oh
my god, where do I start??&quot;), so here are the most important parts:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">The Python Tutorial (<a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/">2.7</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/3.2/tutorial/">3.2</a>). This is a very nice introduction. I
would recommend the first 5 chapters up to &quot;5. Data Structures&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The Library Reference (<a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/library/">2.7</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/3.2/library/">3.2</a>). All the libraries included by default
are described here. As the name implies, this is more of a reference
and less of a learning resource. Still, let me point out three
important sections that you will <em>definitely</em> need later:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Built-in Functions: These are <em>always</em> available in your code and highly
useful.</li>
<li>Built-in Types: Shows the data types in the language (booleans, integers,
lists, ...) and the methods they offer.</li>
<li>How do you capitalize a string? How to split a string into words? Want
to know, which other string methods are available? Unfortunately, the
string documentation is buried deeply within the library reference:
Click on &quot;5.6 Sequence Types&quot; and then &quot;String Methods&quot;. Oh, the last
link is hidden <em>within</em> the first big paragraph of text on sequence
types. I wish I knew why this one is so hard to find.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ignore the Library Reference for now, but keep it in mind for later.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="books-online">
<h2>Books Online</h2>
<p>Of course, there are also many printed books. But to let you jump right in
from your computer, here's a selection of ebooks:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">Learn Python The Hard Way</a> by Zed
Shaw. A series of 52 exercises that let/make you do things yourself instead
of just reading them. Very practically oriented (I've heard).</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/">Think Python - How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</a>: Often mentioned as a good
beginner's book that also teaches a bit about programming in general.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/Python">A Byte of Python</a>: Very
beginner-oriented and easy to start with. I remember this one helped me a
lot in my early Python days, but back then I didn't know about the other
books, so I cannot compare them.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="python-exercises">
<h2>Python Exercises</h2>
<p>At some point, only reading tutorials and books gets boring and you might want
to start writing programs. Besides the exercises in the books above, there are
some fun online challenges:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>: A number of mathematical and algorithmical programming
problems, where you can track your progress nicely with a personal user
account. I like it, but its focus on math does more to teach you algorithms
in general than Python in particular.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.pythonchallenge.com">Python Challenge</a>: A &quot;programming riddle&quot; in the style of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.deathball.net/notpron/">Notpron</a> aimed to teach Python in the
process. Why I like this very much: It poses challenges in several different
areas (how to do HTTP-requests in Python, image analysis, ...), so you get
a broad look at the language and what it can do.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="python-style-guide">
<h2>Python Style Guide</h2>
<p>Should I name my variables in <tt class="docutils literal">CamelCase</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">lowercase_with_underscore</tt>?
And what is it about Python's indentation: Do I use 2 spaces? 4 Spaces? Tabs?
What other conventions should I follow in my code? Some people ignore these
questions at first and start coding right away. Coding guidelines distract
them from learning the language itself.</p>
<p>That is perfectly fine, but it is hard for me to do. When learning a new
language, I need to know about the &quot;right way&quot;. First, it means I don't have
to rewrite my code later and I have consistency right from the start. Second,
the existence and the contents of a style guide reveal something about the
language's culture. If the guide tells you: &quot;Do whatever the hell you want!&quot;
or there is none at all, that says something about the language (probably that
it's C++. Wait, sorry - C++ is the one where there are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/">several</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/">contradicting</a> best practices, which makes me feel guilty
before having written a single line of project code). Third, following the
guide means that I've got one less item to think about during programming.
It gets easier to focus on the actual coding, because I don't need to worry
about pesky style issues. Oh, and last: When everybody writes code
along the same rules, reading other people's code gets so much easier.
So, if you're one of those persons that likes to know about coding guidelines:
Python has exactly one, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">official style guide</a> and most Python programmers tend
to adhere to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="libraries-package-management">
<h2>Libraries/Package Management</h2>
<p>Sooner or later, you might want to use some of those thousands of Python
libraries. Fortunately, Python has a package management system that makes
things easy for you. Unfortunately, Python has more than one package
management system, that makes things easy for you. There's:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><a class="reference external" href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall">EasyInstall</a>: It's
part of the <tt class="docutils literal">setuptools</tt> library, and lots of Python packages tell you to
simply write:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
easy_install SomePackage
</pre>
<p>But this library is <strong>old</strong> and only works on Python 2.x. Do not use it
anymore.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute">Distribute</a>, a fork of the
<tt class="docutils literal">setuptools</tt> library which gives you EasyInstall both on Python 2 <em>and</em>
3. It also fixes lots of old bugs.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip">pip</a>: The new kid on the block. Also,
the better one. With pip, the syntax is:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip install SomePackage
</pre></div>
<p>Which one, you ask? To keep it short: Use pip! If you are not convinced, read
<a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip#pip-compared-to-easy-install">this</a>.
Ironically, you need setuptools/distribute to install pip. So, here's what you
do:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Download <tt class="docutils literal">distribute_setup.py</tt> from <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute#installation-instructions">here</a> and execute it like this:</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>python distribute_setup.py
</pre></div>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>Download the <a class="reference external" href="https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py">get-pip.py</a> install
script (make sure to save it as 'get-pip.py') and run</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>python get-pip.py
</pre></div>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li>You're good to go. Use pip for everything else from now on:</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip install WhateverPackage
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-ultimate-playground">
<h2>The Ultimate Playground</h2>
<p>Python has an interactive interpreter, that allows you to directly type and
execute code. No compiling necessary, no text editor to write and save your
Python file (if you don't want to). It's great for quickly trying out new
things. In order to start the interpreter, simply run <tt class="docutils literal">python</tt> from the
shell of your choice.</p>
<p>Now, wouldn't it be really nice if that interpreter also had automatic
tab-completion? Enter <a class="reference external" href="http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/">IPython</a>, an
enhanced Python shell that gives you goodies like auto-completion, a nice
help system and much more. In order to get it, you need IPython itself and a
working <tt class="docutils literal">readline</tt> module for the tab-completion. For Python 2.7, that
means:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip install ipython
</pre></div>
<p>Then, you need readline. On Linux, you should have it already. On OS X or
Windows, probably not (<a class="reference external" href="http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/html/install/install.html#readline">according to this</a>). On Max OS X you therefore
do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip install readline
</pre></div>
<p>On Windows, you grab a binary <tt class="docutils literal">pyreadline</tt> installer <a class="reference external" href="http://ipython.scipy.org/dist/">right here</a> and run it.</p>
<p>An experimental IPython branch for Python 3 is now available. In that case,
it's best if you read the <a class="reference external" href="http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/Python3">IPython Python 3 notes</a> yourself to check out the current
state of things.</p>
<p>Once you have IPython installed, whenever you want to use the interactive
interpreter you simply use <tt class="docutils literal">ipython</tt> instead of <tt class="docutils literal">python</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summary-tl-dr">
<h2>Summary / tl;dr</h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Install Python or check which version you already have installed.</li>
<li>Install <tt class="docutils literal">distribute</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">pip</tt> for Python (<a class="reference internal" href="#libraries-package-management">details here</a>)</li>
<li>If you're on Python 2.7, grab <tt class="docutils literal">IPython</tt> (see <a class="reference internal" href="#the-ultimate-playground">The Ultimate Playground</a>
above)</li>
<li>Whooo, you can actually start. Do one or more of the following:<ul>
<li>Take a look at the official Python Tutorial (up to section 5)</li>
<li>Check out one of the <a class="reference internal" href="#books-online">recommended ebooks</a></li>
<li>start coding (<a class="reference external" href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>, or <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pythonchallenge.com">Python Challenge</a>, or little
tools for yourself, or ...)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

just send a mail. I'd be happy to improve parts or point out further
things.</p>
